Instapinboard for Chrome
========================

Meant to be an unassuming little guy. 

* Right/ctrl click to add the current page (adds a to-read flag and an "instapinboard" tag)
* If it doesn't have your credentials stored, requires you to enter your [pinboard] [1] credentials.
* Keep on clickin'
